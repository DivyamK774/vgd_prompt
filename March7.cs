// I learnt that you must set or assign a variable before retriving it, and you need to intalize the variable by 
// assigning a value before declaration. Another thing I learnt was that the var keyword tells the complier to deduce 
// the data type based on the valur it is assigned. There are many types of variables like string thats use for phrases, 
// char which is used for single letters, into is used for whole numbers, decimal for fractional components, and finaly, 
// bool for true and false components.
