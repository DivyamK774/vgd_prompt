// Today, I learned that I can use *, /, +, and - for mathematical perposes. I can also use % to get the remainder
// after the division. The operations will be done in the order of BEDMAS. I can use compound opperators like +=, 
// -=, *=, ++, and -- to increment or decrement and then assign the result into the original variable. Finally, I 
// learned incrementing and decrement perform differently depending on in the operator is before or after the 
// operand.
